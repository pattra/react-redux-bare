## react-redux-bare ##

`react-redux-bare` is a lightweight boilerplate featuring React and Redux. It's currently under construction, but feel free to take a look at it now! It includes:

 - [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) & [React DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)
 - [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)
 - [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
 - [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
 - [React-Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
 - [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (for that sweet sweet ES6)
 - [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
 - [SASS](sass-lang.com)

And on the testing side of things:

 - [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
 - [Chai](http://chaijs.com)
 - [JSDom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom)

My goal was to create a lean boilerplate app that can get people started w/ React & Redux with the bare necessities + some crowd favorites. Feedback is welcome!

In the near future I'd like to include more example unit tests and work on a better example Redux app.
